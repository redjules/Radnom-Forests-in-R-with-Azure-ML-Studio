# Random Forests in R with Azure ML Studio

# Project description
In this project we will learn to perform feature engineering and create custom R models on Azure ML Studio, all without writing a single line of code! We will build a Random Forests model in Azure ML Studio using the R programming language. The data to be used in this course is the Bike Sharing Dataset. The dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Using the information from the dataset, you can build a model to predict the number of bikes rented during certain weather conditions. You will leverage the Execute R Script and Create R Model modules to run R scripts from the Azure ML Studio experiment perform feature engineering.
